## Images in your App
For this project, you will update either of your family applications (code or XAML) to show that you can use image resources in a Xamarin.Forms application.

Before modifying your code, create a new branch for this work to keep it separate from your previous assignment code.

Your application should include the image files in your application. Do not access them from the web.  Add an image for each family member in your application.  (The image would ideally be of the family member, but any images will do.) Make sure that your image is displayed with the correct aspect ratio so that the images isn't stretched or squished in one dimension but not another.

## Test
Test your application using the Android & Windows phone emulators (optionally iOS).  Make sure that the layout looks good and that the images display nicely with the text.  Take a screenshot of your successful test on each platform.


## Submit
Commit your changes to your development/feature branch and push to GitHub. Open a pull-request for the work. __Do NOT commit or merge to master.__

Upload the following screenshots to the Assignment box:

1. Your family app running on Android
2. Your family app running on Windows Phone
3. Your family app running on Windows and/or iOS (optional)
4. A GitHub website screenshot clearly showing your GitHub username, repository and open pull-request

Clearly label all the screenshots and add them individually to the dropbox, or paste them into a single MS Word document to upload.   Please do not zip the screenshots.

## Need more practice?
Add styles to update the display of your family app too!
