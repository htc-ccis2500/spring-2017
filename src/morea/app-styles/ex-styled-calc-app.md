## A Styled App
For this project, you will update your calculator application to show that you can use styles in a Xamarin.Forms application.

Before modifying your code, create a new branch for this work to keep it separate from your previous assignment code.

Your application should set up at least two distinctly different styles for the application display (colors, text, buttons, etc.) and should provide one or more buttons shown at the bottom of the display that switch the application style.

## Test
Test your application using the Android & Windows phone emulators (optionally iOS).  Make sure that the layout looks good and that the calculator actually works.  Take a screenshot of your successful test on each platform __showing each style__ that you defined.


## Submit
Commit your changes to your development/feature branch and push to GitHub. Open a pull-request for the work. __Do NOT commit or merge to master.__

Upload the following screenshots to the Assignment box:

1. Your calculator app in each style running on Android
2. Your calculator app in each style running on Windows Phone
3. Your calculator app in each style running on Windows and/or iOS (optional)
4. A GitHub website screenshot clearly showing your GitHub username, repository and open pull-request

Clearly label all the screenshots and add them individually to the dropbox, or paste them into a single MS Word document to upload.   Please do not zip the screenshots.

## Need more challenge?
Add sound to your application so that you make noise when clicking buttons on your calculator. This work may be done on the same project and branch as the style work above.

Add a note on your pull-request to indicate that you completed this challenge.
