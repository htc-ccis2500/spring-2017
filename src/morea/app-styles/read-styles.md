## Background Info
Read Chapters 10-11 of [Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/) by Charles Petzold. These chapters introduce XAML markup extensions and Bindable as a lead in to the discussion of styles in chapter 12.  You can skim through these chapters, but don't just skip it as the information presented is useful to understand how styles work.

For Ch 10, focus on the information on Resource Dictionaries - this is a good lead in to the reading on styles. Chapter 11, is somewhat more important, as it will come up again in multiple topics.  Skim, but read enough detail to understand what a `BindableProperty` is as well as how and why you would create one.

## Styles
Read Chapters 12 of [Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/) by Charles Petzold. This chapter introduces styles for your mobile application.

Setting up styles for your mobile app will allow you to apply the same property settings to multiple elements in your application. This will make it easier to maintain and alter those settings later or to setup different *skins* or *themes* for your application.  Chapter 12 looks at how to define and use styles both in XAML and in C# code.
