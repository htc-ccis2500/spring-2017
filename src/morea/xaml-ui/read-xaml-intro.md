Microsoft Virtual Academy has a video series to introduce mobile application development with Xamarin.Forms presented by Jeff Prosise . We will use these video's along with the reference text to learn to develop cross-platform user interfaces with XAML.

    content="As you watch the videos, make notes on things that are not familiar to you so that you can ask questions and locate additional information to learn more about how various mobile apps are developed and deployed."

## Introduction to Xamarin.Forms (and XAML)
Note that the video is longer, about an hour.  Below the video you will find a list of the topics covered and the specific times when the topic begins with a link to start the video at that point.

The video shows how to convert an Xamarin.Forms application to use XAML, but there is now an option in Visual Studio to begin with XAML so that you do not need to do the conversion.  However it is interesting to see how this could be done, as it allows you to mix code and XAML in your application.
