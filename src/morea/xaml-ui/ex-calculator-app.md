## The Calculator App
For this project, you can choose to create either a basic calculator such as the one you already have on your phone.  This will allow you to use different layout components, such as a grid view, and tie some simple code to run when events are fired in your application.

Create a new Xamarin.Forms XAML application (CalculatorApp) and add it to GitHub.  Push the initial template to the master branch on GitHub, but then remember to setup a development/feature branch to do your work so that you can create a pull-request for grading.


## Test
Test your application using the Android & Windows phone emulators (optionally iOS).  Make sure that the layout looks good and that the calculator actually works.  Take a screenshot of your successful test on each platform to place in the assignment submission box.  


## Submit
Commit your changes to your development/feature branch and push to GitHub. Open a pull-request for the work. __Do NOT commit or merge to master.__

Upload the following screenshots to the Assignment box:

1. Your calculator app running on Android
2. Your calculator app running on Windows Phone
3. Your calculator app running on Windows and/or iOS (optional)
4. A GitHub website screenshot clearly showing your GitHub username, repository and open pull-request

Clearly label all the screenshots and add them individually to the dropbox, or paste them into a single MS Word document to upload.   Please do not zip the screenshots.

## Need more challenge?
If you're ready to try something a little different and with more difficult coding, try creating a Roman Numeral Calculator - one that shows numbers and does math using [Roman Numeral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) Strings instead of integers.  

You may want to begin by figuring this out without [subtractive notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_notation), meaning 9 would be VIIII (5 + four 1's) instead of IX (1 less than 10).

For this challenge, begin by creating a new new Xamarin.Forms XAML application (RomanCalculatorApp) and add it to GitHub. Again push the template app to start, then create a branch for your development work so that you can create the pull-request for grading and feedback.
