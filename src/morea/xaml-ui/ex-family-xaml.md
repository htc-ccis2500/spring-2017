## XAML Family App
For this project, we will convert the family app to use a XAML user interface.

Create a new Xamarin.Forms XAML application (FamilyAppXAML) and add it to GitHub.  Push the initial template to the master branch on GitHub, but then remember to setup a development/feature branch to do your work so that you can create a pull-request for grading.

## Requirements
The structure of the family app should be a vertically scrolling list view with a list item for each member of your family (add at least 5 people).

For each person (list/stack item) include a sentence or two about that person, with their name displayed in bold.  Use a different color for each person.


## Test
Test your XAML based application using the Android & Windows phone emulators (optionally iOS).  Make sure that the layout looks good.  Take a screenshot of your successful test on each platform to place in the assignment submission box.  


## Update the original
Update your original code based application to have the same layout as the XAML version, but writing the code by hand instead of using XAML.  This should clean up the UI for better presentation and allow you to make connections between the XAML and code.


## Test
Test your code based application using the Android & Windows phone emulators (optionally iOS).  Make sure that the layout looks good.  Take a screenshot of your successful test on each platform to place in the assignment submission box.  


## Submit
Commit your changes to your development/feature branch and push to GitHub. Open a pull-request for the work. __Do NOT commit or merge to master.__

Upload the following screenshots to the Assignment box __for both versions__ of your family app:

1. Your family app running on any two of the Android
2. Your family app running on Windows Phone
3. Your family app running on Windows and/or iOS (optional)
4. A GitHub website screenshot clearly showing your GitHub username, repository and open pull-request for

Clearly label all the screenshots and add them individually to the dropbox, or paste them into a single MS Word document to upload.   Please do not zip the screenshots.
