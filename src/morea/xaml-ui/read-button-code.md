## Button Clicks
Chapter 6 of [Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/) by Charles Petzold.  

This chapter introduces event handling code for mobile applications, which conceptually should be familiar from your previous .Net experience.

### Highlights
Note that the chapter walks through a keypad demo which will be similar to the calculator application you will build for this module.  

- Shared click handlers & distinguishing what was clicked
- Anonymous event handlers
- Saving Transient Data
