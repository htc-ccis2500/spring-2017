## Make a New Xamarin.Forms App
Create a new Xamarin.Forms application called Family.  

Add a new `ContentPage` class called `FamilyPage` to the application.  Add text to the page that introduces your family.  Use bold text to make family member names stand out, and use end of line characters to separate each family member.  

Change the application colors and fonts to make your family application unique.  

## Test
Test your application using the Android & Windows phone emulators (optionally iOS).  Take a screenshot of your successful test on each platform to place in the assignment submission box.  (It's helpful if you paste the screenshots into a single MS Word document OR clearly label each image before adding to the assignment box, but please do not zip them.)

## Submit
Zip your project and upload it to the Assignment box on D2L.
