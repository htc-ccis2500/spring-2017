## Background Info
Read Chapters 14 & 17 of [Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/) by Charles Petzold. These chapters introduce the absolute & grid layouts.  


## Absolute Layout
The absolute layout is introduced in Chapter 14 of [Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/). This layout gives you full control over positioning individual elements on the page. Examples are shown using both C# code and XAML.

One of the most common uses of the absolute layout is to place an overlay over your application's user interface, preventing other actions until the overlay is dismissed.  This can be used for passive things like a progress-page or active things like a dialog box.  See if you can use this to make an application *Splash* screen.

## Grid Layout
The grid layout is introduced in Chapter 17 of [Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/). This layout uses a grid to layout elements on a page. Again, examples are shown using both C# and XAML.

This layout is amazingly flexible as the examples show.  There is a grid with elements of different widths & heights, which illustrates what most people would think of as a grid layout, but there is also a bar chart, which is a more creative use of the grid layout.
