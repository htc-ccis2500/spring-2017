## A Slider puzzle
For this project, you will build a slider puzzle. The slider puzzle should be made up of a 4 by 4 grid. Each square on the grid is a piece of an image, with one slot left empty. Initially the images are shown all mixed up, and the puzzle is solved by moving the images right, left, up or down into the open slot.

### Get the images
You can slice up an image using the following web site.  Please make sure that you have choose a safe for class/work image and have rights to use it.  Do not use images that you do not have rights to use.

## Test
Test your application using the Android & Windows phone emulators (optionally iOS).  Make sure that the layout looks good and that the calculator actually works.  Take a screenshot of your successful test on each platform __showing each style__ that you defined.


## Submit
Commit your changes to your development/feature branch and push to GitHub. Open a pull-request for the work. __Do NOT commit or merge to master.__

Upload the following screenshots to the Assignment box:

1. Your calculator app in each style running on Android
2. Your calculator app in each style running on Windows Phone
3. Your calculator app in each style running on Windows and/or iOS (optional)
4. A GitHub website screenshot clearly showing your GitHub username, repository and open pull-request

Clearly label all the screenshots and add them individually to the dropbox, or paste them into a single MS Word document to upload.   Please do not zip the screenshots.

## Need more challenge?
Add sound to your application so that you make noise when clicking buttons on your calculator. This work may be done on the same project and branch as the style work above.

Add a note on your pull-request to indicate that you completed this challenge.
