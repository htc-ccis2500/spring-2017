## A Slider puzzle
For this project, you will build a slider puzzle. The slider puzzle should be made up of a 4 by 4 grid. Each square on the grid is a piece of an image, with one slot left empty. Initially the images are shown all mixed up, and the puzzle is solved by moving the images right, left, up or down into the open slot.

### Get the images
You can slice up an image using the following web site: <http://imagesplitter.net/>.  Please make sure that you have choose a safe for class/work image and have rights to use it.  Do not use images that you do not have rights to use.

## Part 1
Setup the Grid to have sliding images.  Make sure that the grid is responsive to the size of your display.

Update the sample slider demo code so that we have sliding images instead of sliding boxes.

## Part 2
Finish up the game so that it is winnable.

## Test
Test your application using the Android & Windows phone emulators (optionally iOS).  Make sure that the layout looks good and that the calculator actually works.  Take a screenshot of your successful test on each platform that you defined.


## Submit
Commit your changes to your development/feature branch and push to GitHub. Open a pull-request for the work. __Do NOT commit or merge to master.__

Upload the following screenshots to the Assignment box:

3. Your app in each style running on Windows and/or iOS (optional)
4. A GitHub website screenshot clearly showing your GitHub username, repository and open pull-request
