# Tools
For this course we'll be working mainly in MS Visual Studio and versioning our code using Git and GitHub. This means that if you generally work on a Mac, you'll need Windows running either through Boot Camp or a VM such as Parallels, or access to a Windows computer.

You will need:

- MS Visual Studio 2015
- Git for your OS (can be installed through Visual Studio)
- a GitHub account (free is fine, use your student email for Education upgrade)

### Visual Studio
For this course it is important to have Visual Studio 2015 as that is the first version of the Visual Studio product to include the cross-platform mobile development tools that we will be working with in this class.  If you have an older version of Visual Studio, you will need to update though you may be able to keep more than one version of Visual Studio on your computer if needed.  

You can get [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) free from the Microsoft Website.  This includes the mobile tools we will be using for this course, so it is sufficient if you do not have access to the Professional or Enterprise versions.

The Enterprise edition is the version installed in the classroom and students have access to this through their Microsoft Imagine (formerly DreamSpark) account.

### File & Version Management
Configuration files and code are important assets to an organization. Likewise the files you create as part of this course are important assets to you. We will be learning to manage these files professionally using a source code management tool called git which maintains versions of files inside of a repository and [GitHub](https://github.com/) a free, public cloud hosting service for your git repositories.

### The shell
As we work with Git and GitHub, I encourage you to use git commands through the shell to manage versioning your project.  There is a Visual Studio extension for Git, but often is it more clear exactly what you are doing if you use a handful of commands manually from the command line.
