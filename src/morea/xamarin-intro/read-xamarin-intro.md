### First project
A walk-through of creating your first mobile project in Visual Studio with Xamarin.Forms.  This allows you to create one project using Visual Studio to target multiple mobile platforms.  In Visual Studio you will see this as one "solution" with multiple "projects".  There will be shared code in a portable class library, plus code for each mobile platform that we will target.
