## Make a New Xamarin.Forms App
Using the same process demonstrated in the reading, create a new Xamarin.Forms application called AboutMe.  

Update the App.cs file so that the form displays __3-4 sentences__ about you.  Time to introduce yourself to the world!

## Test
Test your application using the Android & Windows phone emulators (optionally iOS).  Take a screenshot of your successful test on each platform to place in the assignment submission box.  (It's helpful if you paste the screenshots into a single MS Word document OR clearly label each image before adding to the assignment box.)

## Submit
Zip your project and upload it to the Assignment box on D2L.
